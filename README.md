# Information about JS that will change your life


## What JavaScript is?

***JavaScript*** is a popular dynamic programming
language that used for front-end, back-end, native mobile and desktop applications.
<!-- C++ is way better -->
***JavaScript*** have many frameworks and addictional applications, like REACT, node.js, Ionic and etc.

In front-end ***Js*** (JavaScript), playing the role of programming language  for building web programms to make the webpage alive.

## History of JavaScript

+ 1995 - Brendan Eich created the first version of JavaScript, that was named Mocha
+ 1996 - Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attract Java developers. But despite the name, JS has nothing to do with Java. It`s a two different languages. 
+ 1997 - With a need of standartize the JavaScript, ECMA releases ES1 (ECMAScript 1), the first official standartization for JS.
+ 2009 - ES5 attracted a large audience of developers because this standart got a lot new great features and made JS more popular.
+ 2015 - the new released ES6 was the biggest update to JavaScript ever.

+ 2016-Nowadays - every year ECMA releases new update, the newest one is ES 

## JavaScript variables types

Totally we have 3 types of variables in **JavaScript** : 

1. var, has used in old versions of JS
2. let, is the new way to declare a variables starting ES6(ES2015)
3. const

## JS data types and groups of types 

We have 8 data types in JS that was divided in two groups: Objects and Primitives.
Primitives are like block elements in HTML, they can hold only one data element inside himself, while objects can hold one and more data elements inside himselfs.

Like any programming language, JS have many rules, and one of them is rule for naming variables.

1. Name must not start with a number or contain spaces.

    1.1 I don`t advise to name your variables randomly, like random text or alphabet letters, if you are a developer working at joint project, cuz you yourself may be confused and your colleagues who will work with your code in future, and they may well read bad dua at you XD (This rule is not mandatory)  

## Operators in Js

JS have arithmetic, logical, comprasion and assigment operators like in many other languages (C++, python, Java and etc.)
Arithmetic operators is the simplest operators that you definetly learned from school if you are greater than 3rd grade. So we skip them. 
***Logical operators*** in JavaScript are three types: logical and, logical or and logical not.
All logical operators works with conditions and can give you only one of two results: true or false;

If just one of conditions is false **Logical and** doesnt work. <br>
If just one condition is true **logical or** works.
<br>**Logical not** make true to false and false to true.

## Conditions
In Js we have three type of conditions:<br>
1. If/else
2. ternary operators
3. switch case
 
### IF/ELSE

```JavaScript
let num = 5;
if(num == 0){
    console.log("Zero");
}
else if(num > 0){
    console.log("Positive");
}
else{
    console.log("Negative");
}
```

### Ternary operators

```JavaScript
let num = 1 == 1 ? "Equal" : "Try again!" ; 
```

### Switch case condition

```JS
let color = "Yellow";

switch (color){
    case "Green":
        console.log("Grass is green");
        break;
    case "Yellow":
        console.log("Bananasa are yellow");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("We dont know this color
        yet");
}
```
